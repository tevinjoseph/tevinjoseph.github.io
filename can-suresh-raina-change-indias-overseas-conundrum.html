            <p><img alt="Suresh Raina raises his bat when he hits century on debut" src="http://p.imgci.com/db/PICTURES/CMS/134800/134878.jpg" /></p>
<p>It's almost certain that <a href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/player/33335.html">Suresh Raina</a> will play 3rd test against Australia in Melbourne. Rohit Sharma will be on the sidelines since he couldn't give justice to his talent. Raina is regarded as one of the best ODI and t20 players that India has ever produced, but he couldn't replicate his form in tests.  Has Raina wasted so many opportunities? He averages a poor 28.44 in tests. He was dropped after his miserable performances in England, Dravid was the only batsmen who tasted success in the series(Virat and Pujara also failed 2014 England series).  Raina was scape goat because selectors has to drop someone after the 4-0 series , Raina was the lone young batsmen so he was dropped.  He was the 2nd highest run getter for India against West Indies which concluded just before the England series.</p>
<p>2014 England series was same the same overseas story for India though India managed to win the Lord's test(Lost 4-1). Indian team was really down after the poor test series.  All Indian's thought that India would fail in ODI series too. But Raina turned the tables with a brilliant 74 ball <a href="http://www.bcci.tv/news/2014/features-and-interviews/8615/when-it-raina-ed-in-cardiff">hundred</a> in Cardiff. India won the ODI series thanks to the enormous energy Raina brought into the team.</p>
<p>Now, India is struggling against Australia (Australia lead the 4 test match series, 2-0).  India has other problems like <a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/sports-news/cricketnews/india-vs-australia-behind-unrest-after-brisbane-test-a-kohli-dhawan-spat/article1-1299351.aspx">Virat-Dhawan spat</a>.  So, Indian's need to prove the world that they still have some fight left. I believe Raina can provide the much needed momentum with his willow and his brilliant fielding. One of the main reasons that India failed in tests is that India's poor slip fielding. Raina is an excellent slip fileder So, he can resolve issues in slips. Raina can also help MSD with his part time bowling too.</p>
<p>Of course, it's documented that Raina's problems against short pitched bowling. Raina has done a lot of hard work to iron out his flaws, recent series' show that the hard work has paid of. Every Indian cricket fan wants India to win the Melbourne test, hope Raina can swing the momentum back  to India's favour.</p>
