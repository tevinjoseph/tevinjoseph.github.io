    <h1 class="title"> 5 reasons for India's series failure against Bangladesh</h1>
    <p class=date> Thu 25 June 2015 </p>
    <p><img alt="First series win for Bangladesh against India" src="http://static.sportskeeda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/478246652-1435174111-800.jpg" /></p>
<p>India toured Bangladesh after entering the semifinals of the World Cup 2015 not so long ago. Their confidence was high since they had done really well on the bouncy pitches in Australia and New Zealand. Also, the men in blue have a terrific record in subcontinent pitches. It was believed that it would be an easy task for India against Bangladesh.</p>
<p>But quite surprisingly, India lost the series 2-1. After losing the first match, a lot of people thought it was just an off day for India, but it wasn't the case. Bangladesh came out with all guns blazing and thrashed India by 6 wickets in the second game and hence clinched the series.</p>
<p>Even though India were able to win the 3rd game comfortably, it was one of the below-par performances of the men in blue. Bangladesh have outplayed India in all departments. India have been found wanting in certain areas. Some of the reasons for the series failures were: </p>
<p><strong>#5 Pacers failed to produce initial breakthroughs</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Indian pacers failed to provide good starts for the team" src="http://static.sportskeeda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/476430034-1435174486-800.jpg" /></p>
<p>Not so long ago, Indian pacers came out with flying colours in the World Cup. The likes of Shami, Umesh and Mohit all were doing really well and ripping through the opposition. They were able to produce initial breakthroughs.</p>
<p>Though India missed the services of Shami who was India's best bowler in the world cup, it would be silly to say that, that is the reason why India were not able to produce early breakthroughs. None of Indian pace bowlers played all the three matches. Mohit and Umesh had gone for plenty in the first match and were axed from the side for the next match. Bhuvneshwar Kumar was dropped in the final ODI.</p>
<p>Umesh Yadav came back into the squad for the third match but was expensive yet again conceding 33 runs in just 4 overs. Dhawal Kulakarni who played the last two games had a decent outing as he picked up 3 wickets at an average of 25.33. </p>
<p>In the whole series, pacers got only 3 wickets in the first ten overs, that itself shows how 
ineffective were they. It is no secret that it is high time that Indian pacers step up and pick up early wickets.</p>
<p><strong>#4 Losing too many wickets in the middle overs</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Dropping of Rahane came as a surprise" src="http://static.sportskeeda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/477588710-1435174316-800.jpg" /></p>
<p>In the first match, India were cruising for a victory as the opening pair put up 96 ball 95. But all of a sudden, India fell from a commanding 95-0 to 128-5, losing Dhawan, Kohli, Rohit, Rahane and Dhoni in quick succession.</p>
<p>After electing to bat in the second match, India lost Rohit in the first over but Dhawan and Kohli stitched a 74 runs partnership. When it looked like India regaining momentum, Nasir Hossain removed Kohli. Like the first game, India collapsed again from 74-1 to 110-4.</p>
<p>India had dropped Rahane for the second match and played Rayudu. But the latter failed to open his account. The move to drop Rahane came as a surprise since he is regarded as the next big thing in Indian Cricket.</p>
<p>Happily for India, they were able to bat more sensibly in the final ODI. The partnership between Dhoni and Rayudu was crucial. Both played well in the middle overs and steadied the ship by adding 93 runs for the 4th wicket.</p>
<p>Dhoni’s promotion to No.4 turned out to be working for India as he was able to score 47 and 69 in the final two matches but we will have to wait and see whether Rayudu cements his place as a No.5 batsman.  </p>
<p><strong>#3 Kohli couldn't set the stage on fire</strong></p>
<p><img alt="India’s premier batsman is going through a lean patch in ODIs" src="http://static.sportskeeda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/477588512-1435174271-800.jpg" /></p>
<p>Virat Kohli is one of the best limited-overs batsmen in recent times. He averages a staggering 50.66 with a strike rate 89.59 and is a master of chasing totals. He scores centuries with ease and already has 22 centuries under his belt.</p>
<p>He has been the lynch-pin of Indian batting line up for the last 4 years. After the terrific hundred against Pakistan in the the World Cup opener, he is going through a lean patch. The prolific batsman has not scored a fifty in his last 10 innings.</p>
<p>The right-hander from Delhi has not lived up to his reputation in the series scoring 1, 23 and 25 respectively. In the last two innings, he got starts but failed to convert those into big ones.</p>
<p>Over the years, he has proved that he has the class to become the best in the world, so it is believed that it is only a temporary loss of form. If India want to stamp their authority in ODIs, they desperately need Kohli to find his mojo back.</p>
<p><strong>#2 Lack of a spinner who can support Ashwin</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Ashwin was effective in all the matches, he didn’t get any support from other-end" src="http://static.sportskeeda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/478160922-1435174221-800.jpg" /></p>
<p>Ashwin bowled really well in all three matches and picked up 6 wickets at a very good average of 19.66 and an economy rate of 3.93 runs per over. He has been able to apply pressure on the Bangladeshi batsmen and was able to control the run flow.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, he didn’t get support from any other specialist spinners. Jadeja has not been accurate after his shoulder injury, so he was neither able to pick up wickets nor able to contain batsmen. After a series of below par performances, he finally got axed from the side for the final ODI.</p>
<p>India played Axar Patel in the second match as a third spinner, but the ploy back fired. He had gone for 48 in his 7 overs in a low scoring second match. He went on to play the next game also, but proved to be ineffective.</p>
<p>Raina has been really good in first and final matches, but India needed one of their specialist spinners other than Ashwin to deliver. Had someone supported India's best offspinner, things could have been different. </p>
<p><strong>#1 No answers for Mustafizur's slower off cutters</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Rahman remained the leading wicket taker in the series" src="http://static.sportskeeda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/477981340-1435148664-800.jpg" /></p>
<p>The wonder boy Mustafizur Rahman has single-handedly thrashed the famous Indian batting line-up by picking up 13 wickets in the series. He got 5-50 in the first game and got the figures of a more impressive 6-43 in the second game. It is hard to believe that this is the debut series of the left armer.</p>
<p>Indian batsmen had no clue for his slower off cutters and almost all the wickets he picked up were of specialist batsmen. He troubled batsmen with his variations. The young bowler has tremendous energy and he is seriously one to watch out for future. </p>
<p>Even though he wasn't able to pick up as many wickets in the final ODI, he has troubled the Indian batsmen. He was right on the money whenever he came on to bowl.
