    <h1 class="title"> Who will be India's No.3 for the second Test against Sri Lanka?</h1>
    <p class=date> Mon 17 August 2015 </p>
    <p>Step into the shoes of great players are not an easy task and it would take time even if someone is able to do so. To fill the voids created by the retirement of legends need both talent and hard work. </p>
<p>Indian cricket team were blessed to get the services of the wall Rahul Dravid over a decade. He was arguably the best test batsman India have ever produced. When he retired he created a huge void in the batting line up which is yet to fill.</p>
<p><strong>Pujara’s stint as India’s No.3</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Pujara is keen to get into the playing eleven" src="http://static.sportskeeda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/pujara-1439739400-800.jpg" /></p>
<p>When Cheteshwar Pujara came into the international scene, experts believed that he was the one who has the capability to be India's long term No.3 and his initial performances suggested the belief was spot on. In his first 17 Tests, he scored a staggering 1590 runs at an average of 66.25. However, last one year has been a major letdown, with the 27-year-old scoring only 483 runs from 10 Tests at a paltry average of 24.15.</p>
<p>The right-hander from Saurashtra hasn't had great outings against New Zealand, England and Australia and found himself out of the squad. His technical flaws were exposed in these tours and people realised that he wasn't comfortable with back foot play.</p>
<p>Pujara wasn't ready to give up and had the desire to be back in the eleven. He had a brief yet successful stint for Yorkshire  as he managed to score 264 runs at an average of 52.8 including  a brilliant 133* in his last match for the county champions.</p>
<p><strong>Rohit Sharma gets more chances at No.3</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Rohit Sharma was preferred over Pujara but the ploy misfired" src="http://static.sportskeeda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/rohit-test-1439739563-800.jpg" /></p>
<p>Cricket pundits expected Pujara to make a come back in the one-off Test against Bangladesh, but the door remained shut as Virat Kohli preferred Rohit Sharma ahead of him.  Even though the Mumbaikar hasn't had success against the Tigers, Kohli persisted with him in the first Test against Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>Rohit had a twin failures in the first Test scoring 9 and 4 respectively. In the debut series against West Indies, he scored 288 runs including two splendid hundreds, but apart from the brilliance in the debut series, Sharma couldn't do anything special in the longest format of the game. Let us have a look at his performances in the past three series.</p>

<p>From the table, it is clear that Rohit has been struggling of late. He has only one 50+ scores in the last three series(9 innings) and to make things worse, in his last 19 innings he has passed fifty only twice.</p>
<p>Sharma's struggle is a blessing in disguise for Pujara as the hopes of getting back into the eleven have been increased.</p>
<p>Will Pujara play the second Test? Or Will Kohli persist with misfiring Rohit?</p>
<p>If a player gets captain's support, the chances of getting a long rope are really big. Virat Kohli has always backed Rohit and team director Ravi Shastri believes Sharma is better than Pujara. So, currently the Mumbai skipper has an edge over Pujara in the team management but if Sharma fails in the second Test, you can see Pujara back in action again.</p>
