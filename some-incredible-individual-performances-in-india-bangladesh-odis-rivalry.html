    <h1 class="title"> Some incredible individual performances in India-Bangladesh ODIs rivalry</h1>
    <p class=date> Mon 08 June 2015 </p>
    <p>India will play 3 ODIs against Bangladesh in Bangladesh starting from June 18. Though, India  has always been a better team than Bangladesh on paper, Bangladesh stunned India several times. There is no doubt in the talent of Bangladeshi cricketers since Bangladesh had produced some really good individual performers over the years. But on most occasions, they failed to perform collectively as a team.</p>
<p>Recent performances suggest that Bangladesh has started to gel together as a team. They entered quarter finals of World Cup by eliminating Eoin Morgan led England team. They also beat their neighbours, Pakistan 3-0 of late.</p>
<p>When India and Bangladesh met last time, India won comfortably by 109 runs, thanks to Rohit Sharma's 137 and Suresh Raina's 65. There are some individuals who stole the show when India played against Bangladesh, some individuals who carried their team in their shoulders. Some of those stellar performances are:</p>
<p><strong>1. Virender Sehwag 175(140)</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Sehwag and Kohli added 200 runs for the 3rd wicket" src="http://static.sportskeeda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/sehwag175-1433767682-800.jpg" /></p>
<p>2011 World Cup began with the India-Bangladesh encounter. After being asked to bat, Sehwag started the proceedings with a boundary of the very first ball. With Sachin at the other end, India got off to a good start by scoring 60 in the first 10 overs. After Sachin's dismissal, Gambhir gave Sehwag a good company until the 24th over when the former perished after a well made run-a-ball 39.</p>
<p>The young Virat Kohli joined Sehwag in the middle. Both played cautiously in the middle overs and saved their best for the end overs. Sehwag went past 100 from 94 balls. Soon after India had taken the batting powerplay, Sehwag cut loose. Then, it was a treat to the eyes for the spectators. He smashed bowlers to all over the park. By the time he was dismissed in the 48th over, he had made 175 and taken India past 350. 14 boundaries and 5 sixes were there in the 140 ball innings. Kohli was also in full flow and scored a breezy 83 ball 100. With the help of Sehwag's and Kohli's heroics, India beat Bangladesh by 87 runs.</p>
<p><strong>2. Mashrafe Mortaza 4-38</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Mortaza was brilliant against India in 2007 World Cup" src="http://static.sportskeeda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/mortaza-1433767839-800.jpg" /></p>
<p>2007 debacle is one of the low points of Rahul Dravid as a captain. It was the 8th match of ICC World Cup, 2007. India won the toss and elected to bat against Bangladesh. India thought it could be a cake walk since India were a much better team with likes of Sachin, Ganguly, Sehwag, Dravid and Yuvraj in the team.</p>
<p>But what happened was the complete opposite of what all were imagined. Mashrafe Mortaza struck in the 3rd over of Indian innings by disturbing the stumps of Sehwag. In the 7th over he picked up the wicket of Uthappa. He swung the ball in both ways and even the great Sachin found it difficult.
He came back to bowl at the end of the innings and bagged two more wickets. Abdur Razzak and Mohammed Rafique also chipped in with 3 wickets each. India bowled out for 191 and only Ganguly and Yuvraj could manage some resistance.</p>
<p>Fifties from Tamim Iqbal, Mushfiqur Rahim, and Shakib Al Hasan sealed the game for Bangladesh and Mortaza was named the man of the match for a brilliant 4-38.</p>
<p><strong>3. Shakib Al Hasan 49(31)</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Shakib Al Hassan - The Bangladeshi All-rounder smashed Indian bowlers all over the park" src="http://static.sportskeeda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/shakib-1433783807-800.jpg" /></p>
<p>4th match of Asia Cup, 2012 often remembered of Sachin's 100th 100. Even though, Sachin achieved the phenomenal record, India lost the match by 5 wickets in the 50th over.</p>
<p>Bangladesh won the toss and chose to field against India. Sachin's 114, Virat's 66 and Raina's 51 helped India to post a healthy 289-5. Though, the opener Nazimuddin fell cheaply for 5 in the 5th over, Tamim Iqbal and Jahurul Islam ensured there were no immediate casualties.</p>
<p>When Shakib came into bat, the asking rate was above 8 an over. He smashed 18 runs off the 37th over, bowled by Ashok Dinda, with a couple of big blows over midwicket and thick edge to third man. Aswin and Irfan Pathan also got the liking of Shakib.</p>
<p>With 66 needed off 50 deliveries, Aswin got rid of Shakib. But the damage was already done. Bangladesh were on top and Mushfiqur Rahim finished things in style with 46 of 25 balls.</p>
<p><strong>4. Stuart Binny 6-4</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Binnyâ€™s incredible 6-4 scripted India an improbable win " src="http://static.sportskeeda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/stuartbinny-1433769171-800.jpg" /></p>
<p>India toured Bangladesh in 2014 June for a 3 match one-day series. India sent a second-string team with Suresh Raina as captain. India won the first match of the series by 7 wickets.</p>
<p>In the second match, India bowled out for just 105. In reply, Bangladesh was cruising towards a famous win with 44-2 but Binny had other ideas. He started the incredible spell with a maiden over. In the 12th over, he got the Bangladeshi captain caught by Saha. Rahim tried to help the ball to fine leg but ends up gloving it and Saha took a comfortable catch.</p>
<p>Then started the Bangladesh batsmen's procession to the pavilion. He picked up the wickets of Mohammad Mithun, Mahmudullah, Mashrafe Mortaza, Nasir Hossain and Al-Amin Hossain for just 4 runs in 4.4 overs. It was a pure exhibition of swing bowling. Binny ended the match with figures of 6-4, which is the best figures for an Indian in ODIs. With Binni's brilliance with the ball, India scripted an improbable 47 runs win.</p>
<p>With India-Bangladesh ODI series around the corner, we can expect some individual brilliances. This time, India have announced a full-strength team which shows India is not taking Bangladesh lightly. Hope it would be an even contest between the two teams</p>
